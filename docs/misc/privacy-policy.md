# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: October 14, 2024**

At \[Your Browser Extension Name], we respect your privacy and are committed to ensuring that your personal information remains secure. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our browser extension, specifically focusing on the fact that we do not collect, store, or share your personal data.

#### 1. Information We Do **Not** Collect

We do not collect any personal information or data from you while you are using our browser extension. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Your name
* Email address
* Browsing history
* Personally identifiable information (PII)
* Device information

#### 2. How Our Browser Extension Works

Our browser extension operates by allowing users to process the content of websites they visit. When you use our extension:

* It extracts content from the websites you visit for analysis, using our APIs to perform certain functionalities, such as text processing or bias detection.
* **None** of the content or data from these websites is stored server-side.
* The processing happens locally on your device or is sent to third-party APIs (like our bias detection APIs) purely for the purpose of processing the website content that you choose to analyze. **No personal data** is collected, shared, or stored during this process.

#### 3. Data Shared with Third-Party APIs

When you use our extension to analyze content from a website, the content of the specific page you choose to process may be sent to our external APIs to perform the requested functions (e.g., text analysis). However:

* These APIs process the data only for the purpose of delivering the analysis results to you.
* No personal information is associated with the processed data, and no personal data is retained.
* We do not share, sell, or disclose any data about your browsing activity or personal identity to third parties.

#### 4. Security

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no risk of your personal data being exposed through our extension. The website content you process is handled securely for the intended purpose and is not used for any other activities.

#### 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect any changes in the way our browser extension operates or to comply with legal requirements. If we make significant changes, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy.

#### 6. Contact Us
